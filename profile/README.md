# Point Zero Systems

Point Zero Systems is focused on building foundations — engines, tools, and systems that favor correctness, performance, and explicit control over abstraction.
Most of what lives here started as internal work. Some of it no longer fits our current direction, but still feels worth releasing rather than archiving or abandoning entirely.
These repositories are shared as **open-source dev releases**. They’re meant to be useful starting points, not finished products.

## Open Source Repos

### Primer
A deterministic approach to codebase synthesis and indexing.

Primer maps a repository and produces a structured index that can be consumed by humans or AI agents, with an emphasis on reproducibility and high-fidelity context.

- Languages: C++, C#, Rust, Go, Java, TypeScript, Python  
- Status: v0.1 (functional, API subject to change)

### Ghostframe FX Core
A low-level, GPU-first glitch effects engine built with Vulkan and C++20.

Designed for real-time use and explicit control, Ghostframe FX Core serves as a foundation for post-processing and live visual experimentation.

- Focus: performance, low latency, GPU-first design  
- Status: v0.1 (dev release)

## Expectations

- These projects are released **as-is**.
- Support and maintenance are **best-effort**, if any.
- Internal versions may diverge significantly from what’s published here.

If you fork it, you own it. If you build something interesting on top, that’s a win.

## License

Unless otherwise noted, projects here are released under the **MIT License**.  
You’re free to use, fork, modify, and monetize.

## Why Open Source?

Because foundations shouldn’t disappear just because priorities change.

Some of this code helped us decide want to build. Some of it still powers internal systems. Either way, it felt better to put it out in the open than to let it sit unused.

More may appear here over time. No guarantees.
